According to World Health Organization (WHO), it is a \"state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community\". It likewise determines how an individual handles stress, interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Mental health includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence,  and self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others. From the perspectives of positive psychology or holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Cultural differences, personal philosophy, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines \"mental health\".

The Cassini\u2013Huygens mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds. Earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere. In contrast, Jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones, Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude, and Venus has a single jet near the equator.", "entities": [[17, 24, "WEATHER"], [113, 120, "WEATHER"], [186, 193, "WEATHER"], [242, 253, "WEATHER"], [341, 347, "WEATHER"], [461, 471, "WEATHER"], [497, 514, "WEATHER"], [625, 635, "WEATHER"], [106, 111, "LOC"], [197, 202, "LOC"], [297, 304, "PERSON"], [324, 329, "LOC"], [453, 458, "LOC"], [481, 484, "CARDINAL"], [516, 521, "CARDINAL"], [555, 562, "LOC"], [606, 611, "LOC"], [645, 649, "ORDINAL"], [679, 684, "LOC"]]}, {"text": "One of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. On other giant planets, the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600 metres per second (about 2,100 km/h or 1,300 mph) have been measured on the planet Neptune. This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists. The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about 1\u2044900 of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth. As of 2007, the strongest planetary winds discovered are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9,600 kilometres per hour (6,000 mph).", "entities": [[86, 104, "WEATHER"], [208, 212, "WEATHER"], [406, 413, "WEATHER"], [439, 451, "WEATHER"], [565, 572, "WEATHER"], [660, 665, "WEATHER"], [0, 3, "CARDINAL"], [36, 52, "LOC"], [54, 61, "LOC"], [131, 149, "DATE"], [248, 275, "QUANTITY"], [277, 293, "QUANTITY"], [297, 306, "QUANTITY"], [341, 348, "LOC"], [489, 496, "LOC"], [500, 516, "CARDINAL"], [537, 542, "LOC"], [586, 593, "LOC"], [617, 622, "LOC"], [630, 634, "DATE"], [779, 804, "QUANTITY"], [806, 815, "QUANTITY"]]}, {"text": "== Space weather ==", "entities": [[9, 16, "WEATHER"]]}, {"text": "Weather is not limited to planetary bodies. Like all stars, the Sun's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the Solar System as Saturn. The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae, and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals.", "entities": [[0, 7, "WEATHER"], [64, 67, "WEATHER"], [153, 163, "WEATHER"], [231, 234, "WEATHER"], [251, 262, "WEATHER"], [287, 291, "WEATHER"], [428, 443, "WEATHER"], [453, 461, "WEATHER"], [466, 470, "WEATHER"], [498, 512, "WEATHER"], [645, 656, "WEATHER"], [707, 717, "WEATHER"], [64, 67, "LOC"], [175, 191, "LOC"], [231, 234, "LOC"], [568, 584, "LOC"], [588, 594, "LOC"]]}]
